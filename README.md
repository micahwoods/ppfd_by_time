The `ui.R` and `server.R` files make a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) app that calculates the expected PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density in units of Âµmol m^-2^ s^-1^) at a user selected time of day, day of the year, and latitude and longitude. The expected DLI (daily light integral, in units of mol m^-2^ s^-1^) for that location on that day is also calculated.

More information about these calculations is given in the [FAO Crop evapotranspiration](http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0490e/x0490e07.htm#radiation) book.
