The `ui.R` and `server.R` files make [this PPFD by time](https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/ppfd_by_time/) [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) app that calculates the expected PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density in units of Âµmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) at a user selected time of day, day of the year, and latitude and longitude. The expected DLI (daily light integral, in units of mol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) for that location on that day is also calculated.

More information about these calculations is given in the [FAO Crop evapotranspiration](http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0490e/x0490e07.htm#radiation) book.
